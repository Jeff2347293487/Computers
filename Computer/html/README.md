         <h3>All about computers</h3>
         Paragraph  1<br>
         <p>
       I really like computers. Computers are nice and fast and can be very powerful. Custom built computers can have a lot of upgrades or lots of choices due to the fact that you can customize them     <p>
       
<p>
But pre built computers are not very good because they do not have as much upgradability and usually cost more then custombuilt computers.
<p>
    <p style="color:green">
        So I think it is better to build your own computer because it is cheaper and one of the pros is learning how a computer works so it is easier to diagnose a problem if something goes wrong with the computer down the line.
